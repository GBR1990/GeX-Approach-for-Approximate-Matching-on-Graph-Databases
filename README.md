# GeX-Approach-for-Approximate-Matching-on-Graph-Databases
Increase in the popularity of social networking websites has increased the need for graph databases as relationships between the data hold an important role here. This project is based on Approximate Matching using the GEX Approach on such databases.

The GeX top-k query answering algorithm has two phases, cursor initialization and cursor access and solution building.

The data was obtained from the BioGRID website which is an updated interaction repository.
The dataset consists of protein and genetic interactions.
>1,16,000 interactions from Saccharomyces cerevisiae(yeast), Caenorhabditis elegans (roundworm), Drosophila melanogaster (fly) and Homo sapiens (humans) in CSV format are available for download.
